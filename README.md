# Time Availability API
- Working internationally comes with its own set of challenges, among them is the challenge of figuring out when people are available. This API can be used to calculate the best meeting slots across time zones

## How to use and Test this application
- Clone or download the repo. In the root folder terminal, run the command `make all` to start up the program server, and run migrations and tests.
- To test the API visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/timeslot` and test with a sample data. An example is shown below:

- You can also test the API route above via postman. 
- To run tests only, run `docker-compose exec web python manage.py test`

## Steps taken to reduce latency
- I avoided the use of third-party APIs, as this could generally slow down response time.
- I made good use of inbuilt and third-party libraries.
- Most of the clean-up logic was done with simple and efficient algorithms.
